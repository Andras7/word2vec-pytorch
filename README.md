# Word2vec Pytorch

Fast word2vec implementation at competitive speed with fasttext. The slowest part is the python data loader. Indeed, Python isn't the fastest language but maybe you can improve it :)

## Advantages

* Easy to understand, solid code
* Easy to extend, to make new experiments
* You can try advanced learning optimizers, with new learning technics
* GPU spupprot

## Supprted features

* Skip-gram
* Batch update
* Cosine Annealing
* Negative Sampling
* Sub-sampling of frequent word
